**vicoo** is not just a knowledge base; it's a **High-Performance Illustrated Book** for your brain. It bridges the gap between a personal wiki, a second brain, and an AI companion, all wrapped in a distinct **Neubrutalism-lite** aesthetic.

## ✨ Philosophy: What is "Vibe Coding"?

Traditional note-taking apps are sterile archives. **vicoo** is designed to be:

1.  **Alive**: Animated mascots react to your work state. It feels like a collaboration, not data entry.
2.  **Spatial**: Knowledge is a galaxy, not just a list of files.
3.  **Proactive**: The "Neural Gardener" suggests connections before you realize them.
4.  **Tactile**: Bold borders, pop colors, and satisfying interactions make knowledge work feel like a game.
